Primarily targeted to Linux/BSD users, uSync allows for automatic wireless syncing with the Apple iPhone.  It is essentially just a couple shell scripts that interact in a sort client-server situation.

  * Initiate syncing from the phone
  * Receive new music/podcast alerts while away from the computer
  * Fully automatic or manual syncing modes

### NOTE: ###
  * Requires SVN GTKPod/libgpod and SVN GNUPod (with a couple extra modifications)
